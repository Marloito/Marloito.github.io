	<p>I created this site to be a basic template for my portfolio that I can build upon over time. I am using the portoflio of another developer in Seattle to compare to. It was difficult to find any portfolios that were very similar because they are sites used to showcase skills, that I have not yet learned.  I found <a href="http://paulcalabrese.me/">Paul Calabrese's portfolio</a> to be an excellent example, as it simple to navigate. I think in the future I would like to keep my portfolio on one page as well, as it will keep viewers engaged with my content longer. I see a lot of HTML in Paul's code, but I don't recognize most of the code. For example he links to many stylesheets, where I assume he uses CSS to add life to his page.</p>
